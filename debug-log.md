1. I used ultrasonic distance sensor to measure the distance from the robot to the wall. I expected it to measure the accurate dimensions for each x, but it did't work. The ultrasonic distance sernsor gave me the lowest found measurement in its wide scope instead. First I was looking for another codes, but none worked for my expectations. I found, that I will need another sensor to give me the accurate dimension so I used High Performance Ultrasonic Range Finder LV-MaxSonar-EZ4 and it works. Now I receive accurate dimension each time.
2. I used Continuous Rotation Servo Motor to rotate the distance sensor so it can scan the whole room. I expected it to rotate slowly in 360 scope which will allow my distance sensor to measure accurate dimensions. The servo motor didn't want to rotate slowly, step-by step so I thought it was fault of my code. I tried many different codes but none worked. After talking about it with other students I realized, that maybe I will need another motor. I tried stepper motor, but finally I found Servo Motor that rotates in the 180 degrees scope, I connected them to each other, used simple code example and it worked. 
3. By using two Servo motors I wanted to achieve the rotation in the scope of 360 degrees (180 by one servo and 180 by another servo), so the distance sensor can scan the whole room. I wrote the code for the first servo motor to move from the position of 0 degrees to the position of 180 degrees, for the second servo the same but it didn't work. They were rotating in the opposite directions which made the distance sensor still scanning only 180 degrees with a strange unexpected behavior of the motors. I tried many code modifications to find a bug, finally someone advised me to detach everything, set the first servo and if it will work to set second servo. What I found was that both servos has got different dirrections of the rotations. For the bottom's one 180 degrees is the same as for top's one 0 degrees and the opposite. 
After writing the codes in processing and arduino I realised that the distance sensor wants to draw a circle each time instead of drawing a rectangular floor plan. I found IR distance sensor. It worked on the very small scope so I needed to fing another sensor which will give me the scope more that 100cm. It worked well.
During the rotation of one servo the distance sensor gave me vry different numbers that another one. I realized that it can be caused of the difference of the company that produced those servos. I decided to replace one servo to make them the same. This way both servos worked in the same way and gave me better numbers.
